== design guide for common functions ==

it is nice to put common functions in a place that can be called by all scripts. however, we don't want to put _every_ function there, because many functions will be script specific.

  * if a function is duplicated in two or more scripts, it should be migrated to include_common.php.
  * if a function is in include_common.php but is only used in one script, it should be migrated to that specific script.

== list of functions in include_common.php ==

  * message($label, $title, $body)
  * formatdate($timestamp, $format = "M j, Y, g\:i a")
  * admin()
  * outputbody($input)
  * output($input)
  * showerror()
  * clean($input)
  * validateEmail($email)
  * deleteAvatar()
