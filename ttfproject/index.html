            <h1>Welcome to the Think Tank Forums Project</h1>
            <p>This is the official website for the Think Tank Forums Project,
            <strong>BSD licensed</strong> web forum software that uses
            <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP 4</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL 4.1</a>.
            To see our software in action, check out <a href="http://www.thinktankforums.com/">Think Tank Forums</a>,
            our sister site. On this page, you'll find our project goals,
            milestones, source code, and further development information.</p>
            <h2>Project goals</h2>
            <p>The TTF Project aims to produce extremely <strong>fast</strong>
            and <strong>clean</strong> web forum software. The forum lacks
            most features offered by other software&mdash;a fact that we are
            extremely proud of.</p>
            <p>Our primary aims include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fast: minimize CPU time and HTML with optimized queries.</li>
                <li>Clean: keep features, PHP, and XHTML unbloated.</li>
                <li>Data obsessive: maximize information retention.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Of course, we also care about security and an intuitive layout.
            Security is easy because best practices are easy to implement and
            track with clean code. An intuitive layout can flourish when
            unnecessary features are avoided and XHTML is valid.</p>
            <h2>The data obsession</h2>
            <p>TTF was designed around a tight-knit community from Billings,
            MT. In the past, blog software shared among this group experienced
            large losses in content when a user would opt to delete <em>all</em>
            of their entries. To prevent such substantial losses in
            information, TTF software does not offer edit and delete features.
            Instead, TTF offers a <strong>versioning system</strong> that
            allows content to be altered (with complete revision tracking) or
            archived (with content retrieval.)</p>
            <p>We realize that many users appreciate the option of permanently
            removing their contributions, and that people will be less willing
            to post without such options. However, the project holds that
            all information is valuable, and the costs of storage are minimal.
            Furthermore, user deletion of threads removes others' content
            without their permission, and user deletion of posts can make
            the resultant exchanges appear incoherent.</p>
            <h2>Milestones</h2>
            <p>The project is still approaching an official stable release.
            Development is sporadic, yet we expect a complete <em>version 1</em>
            release in June 2007. There are <a href="http://code.google.com/p/thinktankforums/issues/list">a multitude of issues</a>
            that remain unresolved. Perhaps the most substantial problem now
            is that our diff functions do not support multibyte characters.
            Resolution of this issue (along with the addition of a few other
            features) will quickly lead to a <em>version 1</em> release.</p>
            <p><em>version 2</em> will likely implement web 2.0 techniques,
            including some use of asynchronous HTTP requests. The layout may
            be extensively modified, yet we don't anticipate many new features.
            Focus will be given to usability and speed.</p>
            <h2>Source code</h2>
            <p>Source is only available via Subversion, because the project
            hasn't yet made an official release. You can access our repository
            through our <a href="http://code.google.com/p/thinktankforums/source">Google Code project page</a>.</p>
